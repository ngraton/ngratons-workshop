# Overview of the ngraton.dev redesign

This site is getting an extensive makeover based around my concept of a virtual workshop.

In my workshop I have all my projects, my notes, my tools, relevant references, and, ideally, detailed guides from past projects. I want to build the site around these same areas.

Like a workshop, this site will be organized around, heck its entire reason of being is to work on, projects. I'd like a section for every project I'm working on, completed projects will be turned into guides more to follow on that.

## Why?

Redesign based around the idea of a workshop
- The is the place where I build, not the place where I "sell" - the studio, not the gallery
- link to the idea of workinng with the garage door up from that other note blog
- learning in public and digital gardens
- projects appear as the are in progress, not just write ups and finished products after the fact
- show your work
	- references and tools linked to each project and have their own page
	- notes (including these) up on the site and tied to their respecive projects
	- code in projects written with an audience in mind (comments and explanations)
	- atomic commits
- still have a blog
	- talk about whatever is on my mind, what i'm working on, etc..
	- built out of notes (many) but writen as a longer peice
